# Whitelist Dapp

A simple Dapp which user can connect their wallet an register their address to a whitelist.

> The original project is from [LearnWeb3DAO - Whitelist Dapp](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp)

- Branch `v1.0` is basically the same code
- `main` branch differs from the original with the use of [Rainbow Kit](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow) and [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) instead of `web3Modal`

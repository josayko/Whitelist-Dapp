# Whitelist Dapp

A simple Dapp which user can connect their wallet an register their address to a whitelist.

> The original project is from [LearnWeb3DAO - Whitelist Dapp](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp)

- Branch `v1.0` is basically the same code
- `main` branch differs from the original with the use of [Rainbow Kit](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow) and [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) instead of `web3Modal`

- The app is deployed with Vercel at
  https://whitelist-dapp-teal-seven.vercel.app/
- The smart contract is deployed on Goerli testnet with a limit of whitelisted addresses set to 10
- You can deploy the smart contract yourself and run the frontend app locally if the limit has been reached
